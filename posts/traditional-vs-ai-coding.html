        The journey from traditional coding setups with single monitors to today's AI-powered, multi-display environments 
        represents one of the most dramatic shifts in software development. While technology has undoubtedly accelerated our 
        capabilities, it has also fundamentally changed how we work—and not always for the better.
      </p>

      <h2 id="traditional-era">The Traditional Coding Era</h2>
      <p>
        In the earlier days of programming, our setup was refreshingly simple: a single monitor, a keyboard, and often 
        a trusty whiteboard nearby. We relied heavily on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical whiteboards</strong> for system design and problem-solving</li>
        <li><strong>Paper notebooks</strong> for jotting down ideas, algorithms, and debugging notes</li>
        <li><strong>Single-tasking focus</strong> with one application at a time</li>
        <li><strong>Mental models</strong> built through deeper contemplation</li>
        <li><strong>Peer discussions</strong> around physical spaces</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="ai-era">The AI-Assisted Era</h2>
      <p>
        Today's development environment is dramatically different. Multiple monitors display code, documentation, AI chat 
        interfaces, and various tools simultaneously. Everything happens on-screen, creating an entirely digital workflow.
      </p>

      <h2 id="pros-cons">Pros and Cons Analysis</h2>
      
      <h3 id="pros">Advantages of AI-Assisted Development</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Speed and Efficiency</strong> – AI can generate boilerplate code, suggest solutions, and automate repetitive tasks</li>
        <li><strong>Instant Access to Information</strong> – No need to search through documentation; AI provides context-aware help</li>
        <li><strong>Code Quality Improvements</strong> – AI can catch bugs, suggest optimizations, and enforce best practices</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Acceleration</strong> – Exposure to different coding patterns and approaches</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-tasking Capability</strong> – Handle multiple projects and contexts simultaneously</li>
        <li><strong>24/7 Availability</strong> – AI assistants don't take breaks or have off days</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="cons">Disadvantages and Concerns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eye Strain and Health Issues</strong> – Prolonged screen time across multiple displays increases fatigue</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Deep Thinking</strong> – Quick AI answers may discourage thorough problem analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Over-dependence</strong> – Risk of losing fundamental problem-solving skills</li>
        <li><strong>Context Switching Overhead</strong> – Multiple displays can lead to distraction and reduced focus</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Physical Collaboration</strong> – Less whiteboarding and face-to-face problem-solving</li>
        <li><strong>Information Overload</strong> – Too many options and suggestions can be overwhelming</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Code Understanding</strong> – Copy-paste mentality without fully grasping the solution</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="health-impact">Health Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Multi-monitor setups increase eye strain and reduce physical movement.

      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The evolution from traditional coding environments to AI-assisted development represents both tremendous progress 
        and new challenges. While we've gained unprecedented productivity tools, we must be mindful of the health and 
        cognitive trade-offs.
